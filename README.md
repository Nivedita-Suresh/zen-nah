### Project Description
[### Project Description
[A web app that guides you through calm breathing exercises‚Ä¶ while constantly interrupting you with random, irrelevant trivia so you can‚Äôt actually relax.]

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[People are getting too calm during meditation. Inner peace levels are dangerously high, and boredom is striking mid-breath.]

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[We fixed meditation by adding completely useless facts every few seconds, ensuring you stay mildly entertained, slightly distracted, and nowhere near Zen.]
