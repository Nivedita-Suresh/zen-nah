# ZEN?NAH üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Techreno


### Team Members
- Member 1: Anvi keertana R - Government engineering college kozhikode
- Member 2: Nivedita Suresh - Government engineering college kozhikode

### Project Description

A web app that guides you through calm breathing exercises‚Ä¶ while constantly interrupting you with random, irrelevant trivia so you can‚Äôt actually relax.]

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People are getting too calm during meditation. Inner peace levels are dangerously high, and boredom is striking mid-breath.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We fixed meditation by adding completely useless facts every few seconds, ensuring you stay mildly entertained, slightly distracted, and nowhere near Zen.


## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- Languages used-HTML,CSS,Javascript
- Frameworks used-none
- Libraries used-Vanilla Javascript, SVG
- Tools used-Code editor VS Code
- Web browser developer tools for testing
  Online image/logo editors Canva for assets
  Git/GitHub for version control 


### Implementation
For Software:The project is implemented as a simple front-end web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML provides the structure ‚Äî an SVG path for the ball animation, a moving ball element, text prompts for breathing phases, and a container for random trivia. CSS handles styling, positioning, and smooth animations to give the app a calming (but deceptively misleading) aesthetic. JavaScript drives the animation logic, calculating the ball‚Äôs position along the path for inhale, hold, and exhale phases, updating the prompts in real-time, and injecting random trivia at set intervals to maintain the ‚Äúuseless‚Äù distraction effect. The app runs entirely in the browser and can be deployed easily on GitHub Pages or any static hosting service.

*The ball moves up ‚Äî you breathe in.
The ball stops ‚Äî you hold your breath.
The ball moves down ‚Äî you breathe out.
Somewhere in between‚Ä¶ chaos happens as random useless facts crash into your peaceful moment.‚Äù

*Build Process

The creation of ZEN?NAH followed a very calm and mindful development flow‚Ä¶ until we ruined it with distractions. We began by setting up a simple three-file structure ‚Äî index.html, styles.css, and script.js ‚Äî so we could keep the breathing animation logic, styling, and markup neatly separated. The HTML provides the core structure: an SVG path for the ball‚Äôs journey, a circular ‚Äúball‚Äù element, and a text prompt that changes between Breathe In, Hold, and Breathe Out. We also added a container for our ‚Äúuseless‚Äù element: a random trivia box that interrupts you right when you‚Äôre starting to feel relaxed.

Once the structure was ready, we moved to CSS, styling the background, centering the animation on the screen, and making the ball smooth, round, and aesthetically pleasing (which is completely wasted since your focus will be stolen by irrelevant facts). The SVG path was given a soft, barely-visible line to guide the animation, while typography and color schemes were chosen for maximum serenity‚Ä¶ before the chaos begins.

Finally, in JavaScript, we calculated the SVG path length so the ball could move smoothly along it. We defined three breathing phases with precise durations for inhale, hold, and exhale. Using requestAnimationFrame, we animated the ball‚Äôs position along the path and updated the on-screen instructions in sync with the breathing cycle. A random fact generator was added to trigger every few seconds, ensuring you never achieve true Zen. Once tested locally in a browser, the project was ready to deploy on GitHub Pages so anyone can be distracted in style.*
